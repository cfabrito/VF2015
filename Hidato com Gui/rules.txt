In Hidato, a grid of cells is given. It is usually square-shaped, like Sudoku or Kakuro, but it can also include irregular
	shaped grids like hearts, skulls, and so forth. It can have inner holes (like a disc), but it has to be made of only
	one piece.

The goal is to fill the grid with a series of consecutive numbers adjacent to each other vertically, horizontally, or
	diagonally.

In every Hidato puzzle the smallest and the highest numbers are given on the grid. There are also other given numbers on the
	grid (with values between the smallest and the highest) to help direct the player how to start the solution and to
	ensure that Hidato has a single solution.

Note: the above condition on the smallest or highest numbers are sometimes relaxed: only their values can be given, without 
	their positions on the grid (of course, the difference between these values must be equal to the number of cells in 
	the grid minus one). This may lead to harder puzzles.

Every well-formed Hidato puzzle is supposed to have a unique solution. Moreover, a Hidato puzzle intended for human solvers 
	should have a solution that can be found by (more or less) simple logic. However, there exist very hard Hidato puzzles,
	even of small size.
